RANSOMWARE:

-Use openssl to actually encrypt/decrypt the files.
-use my previously created file transversal program to transverse all files/ lock em down...
-do cool stuff
-need to get rsa public key from server to setup public 



So the encrypt.c will encrypt and decrypt the files


not sure if I should delete encrypt afterwards then just have a decrypt file...
need a server setup on my end to send results too
-this server will return a key/ iv/ customer id which will be used to identify the computers
-need a decrypt program which should just get the key/iv from the server while giving a customer id
	-this server will need to validate bitcoin was recieved 
	-also need a timestamp.. after 4 days then no go
Need to setup a better driver,
	-recursively go through all files
	-exclude certain directories like system programs etc.. Need this computer to be usable
	-Maybe free decryption of one? idk though
Probably just delete my server.c program... don't need it unless I want to use the computer as a proxy... Maybe in future though
-All I really need is just a driver at this point
-This driver will need to connect to server 
	-o and the customer id will need to be written down

-TOR C&C server will be a java spring RESTful api...

-connect to TOR
-first must have tor running
-then must set tor as default proxy...localhost so 127.0.0.1 port 9050
-then try to connect to .onion address of the hidden service..
-to test, maybe simplify with an amazon ec2 instance and a curl GET request
-connect to host server which connects to the tor service for me.. that gives another level of abstraction, makes it harder to find tor .onion site.
	-alsoeasier to connect via c... TOR doesn't have to be running
